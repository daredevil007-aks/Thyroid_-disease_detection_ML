Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various medical features relevant to thyroid function, such as hormone levels, patient age, and other diagnostic measurements. The data is sourced from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:

Handling Missing Values: Replacing or imputing missing data points.
Feature Encoding: Converting categorical variables into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Normalization: Scaling numerical features to a standard range to improve model performance.
Model Selection
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) are chosen for their robustness and ability to handle complex datasets with high accuracy. GBMs work by building an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree corrects the errors of the previous ones.

Training the Model
The model is trained using the following steps:

Splitting the Data: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to find the optimal hyperparameters.
Model Training: Training the GBM on the training dataset with the chosen hyperparameters.
Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as:

Accuracy: The proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined.
Precision: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
Recall (Sensitivity): The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in actual class.
F1 Score: The weighted average of Precision and Recall.
